    "In many cases our data comes from a heterogeneous sample. Heterogeneity can be both compositional and conformational. Interpretation of data collected on a heterogeneous sample requires a *multi-state model*. A multi-state model is a model that specifies two or more co-existing structural states and values for other parameters, such as the weights of each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMP includes a command line tool `multi_foxs` for enumeration and scoring of multi-state models against SAXS profiles. There is also a [web interface](https://salilab.org/multifoxs/) available, which functions similarly.\n",

    "In this example, we will demonstrate how to use it using PDB structures of replication protein A and a simulated SAXS profile.\n"

        "In many cases our data comes from a heterogeneous sample. Heterogeneity can be both compositional and conformational. Interpretation of data collected on a heterogeneous sample requires a *multi-state model*. A multi-state model is a model that specifies two or more co-existing structural states and values for other parameters, such as the weights of each state.\n",

Fitting against SAXS data with FoXS and MultiFoXS {#mainpage}
=================================================

Some proteins or their complexes can be characterized using small angle X-ray
(SAXS) experiments. SAXS differs from X-ray crystallography in that it is
applied to proteins in solution rather than crystals; thus, it can be
applied to a much wider range of proteins in states more closely resembling
their functional forms than X-ray crystallography. Because the sample is
in solution, the SAXS information is rotationally averaged and so the
resulting SAXS profile gives less structural information than X-ray
crystallography; however, this is often sufficient to determine problems
with the structure or to distinguish possible conformations.

%IMP includes tools for fitting both single-state and multi-state models
against SAXS data, both of which are introduced here:

- [FoXS: fitting single structures against SAXS data](@ref foxs)

- [MultiFoXS: determination of multi-state models](@ref multifoxs)
